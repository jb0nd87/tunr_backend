# Ruby on Rails Mini Project

For this lab, your goal is to build a simple CRUD app with Ruby on Rails on the back-end and React on the front-end.

## Prerequisites

- Rails, Ruby and React
- React, Components, State and Props
- React Component Lifecycle Methods (useEffect)

## Instructions

1.  Fork and Clone this repo
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.
1.  Create a Pull request on this repository with links to your repo(s).

Unlike most labs, for this one you will submit your work by **making a pull request**. If a pull request has not been performed up until now then the instructor will walk the class through performing one at the completion of this readme.

Use this repo to include both the frontend and backend servers. 

The frontend and the backend should be in two separate folders. They will each need to be a github repository.

## Requirements

Build a simple CRUD/RoR app! Keep it very simple: **only** 1 model with full CRUD.

Your app will need to replicate the functionality and style of the Tunr image above. The app should:

- Only have one page, the homepage.
- Display a playlist and a favorite song list on the homepage
- Allow users to add a new song that has a title, artist and time (length of playtime) to a playlist 
- Allow users to favorite a song. When they favorite a song, a heart should appear next to the song in the playlist and the song should appear underneath the Favorite Songs List.
- Allow users to remove the song from the playlist

## Bonus
- Add a User Model (no auth unless you want to go above and beyond)
- Have a User be able to create a Playlist
- Create a User profile to display various playlists

## Double Bonus
Deploy your app. Use Heroku for the backend and Surge or Netlify for the frontend. 

## Triple Bonus
- Refactor your components into styled components
- Style your front end to portfolio quality (responsive, unique... etc)

## Presentation
Don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

  * Is ~5 minutes in length
  * Shows off all features of the app
  * Explains the technical details
  * Explains the technical challenges
  * Explains which improvements you might make
